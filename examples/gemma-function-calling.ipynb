    "Google Gemma 3 27B It is an open, multilingual, multimodal Vision-Language model. It handles context windows up to 128k tokens, understands over 140 languages, and offers improved math, reasoning, and chat capabilities, including structured outputs and function calling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gemma 3 can be used for agentic workflows and has very strong instruction following capabilities. While there are no dedicated tool/function calling special tokens, you can prompt it to do function calling through careful instruction. Gemma 3 27B is available via [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemma-3-27b-it) and the Gen AI API. Get an API key from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and use it to make requests to the Gen AI API.\n",
